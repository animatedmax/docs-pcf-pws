title: Scaling an Application Using Autoscaler
owner: PCF Autoscaler

This topic describes how to configure Autoscaler to automatically scale applications based on rules that you set. 

## <a id="overview"></a> Autoscaler Overview 

Autoscaler is a marketplace service that ensures app performance and helps control the cost of running apps. 

To balance app performance and cost, Space Developers and Space Managers can use Autoscaler to:

* Configure rules that adjust instance counts based on metrics thresholds such as CPU Usage. 
* Modify the maximum and minimum number of instances for an app, either manually or following a schedule.

## <a id="setup"></a>Set up Autoscaler

To use Autoscaler, you need to create an instance of the Autoscaler service and bind it to any app you want to autoscale. You can do this using either the Apps Manager or from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI):

* **Apps Manager**:
	1. [Create an instance](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/use-console.html).
	1. [Bind the service to an app](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html#bind-services).

* **cf CLI**:
	1. [Create an instance](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace).
	1. [Bind the service to an app](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html#bind).

## <a id="config"></a>Configure Autoscaling for an App

Autoscaler keeps instance counts within an allowable range defined by user-settable minimum and maximum values called _instance limits_.

Follow these steps to configure the instance limits and set rules for when Autoscaler scales your app.

1. In PWS, select an app from the space in which you created the Autoscaler service and click **Services**. 

1. Select the Autoscaler service from the list of services, and then click **Manage**.

1. Follow the procedures in the sections below to set any of the following:

	* [Instance Limits](#limits)
	* [Scaling Rules](#metric)
	* [Scheduled Limit Changes](#schedule)

### <a id="limits"></a>Instance Limits

Follow these steps to manually modify instance limits:

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> changes to your instance limits for a specific date and time.</p>

1. Click the edit icon next to **Instance Limits**. 

1. Enter values for **Minimum** and **Maximum**. 

	![Limits](instance-limits.png)

1. Click **Save**.  

### <a id="metric"></a>Scaling Rules

To keep your apps available without wasting resources, Autoscaler increments or decrements instance counts based on how current metrics compare with user-settable High and Low thresholds. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: All rules are active by default.</b>
</p>

#### How Autoscaler Determines When to Scale

Autoscaler scales apps:

* up by one instance when any metric exceeds the **High** value specified
* down by one instance only when all metrics fall below the **Low** value specified

#### Set Metric High and Low Values
Follow these steps to modify scaling rules by setting high and low values for the available metrics:

1. Click the edit icon next to **Scaling Rules**. 

1. Activate or deactivate each rule using the toggles next to <b>Rule Status</b>.

	![Scaling Rules](rules.png)

1. Set the **Low** and **High** values for each metric using the table below as a guide.

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Metric</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CPU</td>
			<td>Average CPU percentage for all instances of the app</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

1. Click **Save**.


### <a id="schedule"></a>Scheduled Limit Changes

Because app demand often follows a weekly, daily, or hourly schedule, you can schedule Autoscaler to change the allowable instance range to track expected surges or quiet periods. 

#### Create or Modify a Scheduled Limit Change

1. Click the clock icon next to **Scheduled Limit Changes**. 

1. Click **+New** to add a new scheduled limit change or choose an existing entry to modify. 
	* To delete an existing entry, click the **X**.

1. Edit the following values:
	![Scheduled limit changes](scheduled.png)
	* **on** and **at**: Set the date and time of the change. 
	* **repeats every**: Set the day of the week for which you want to repeat the change.  
	* **Min Instances** and **Max Instances**: Set the allowable range within which Autoscaler can change the instance count for an app.

1. Click **Save**. 

#### Example: Scale Down for the Weekend

To schedule an app to scale down for a weekend, you can enter two rules as follows:

1. Scale down to a single instance on Friday evening:
	* **on** and **at**: `28/10/2016` and `19:00`
	* **repeats every**: `F`
	* **Min Instances** and **Max Instances**: `1` and `1`
2. Increase instances to between 3 and 5 on Monday morning:
	* **on** and **at**: `31/10/2016` and `7:00`
	* **repeats every**: `M`
	* **Min Instances** and **Max Instances**: `3` and `5`

## <a id="notifs"></a>Manage Autoscaler Notifications

Autoscaler logs events and emails you event notifications by default.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also view the event history for an app by clicking the list icon next to <strong>Last Event</strong> in the Autoscaler UI.</p>

Follow these steps to subscribe or unsubscribe from Autoscaler event notifications:

1. Navigate to the [Manage Notifications](https://notifications-ui.run.pivotal.io/preferences) page of PWS. 

1. Choose which notifications you want to receive from Autoscaler:
